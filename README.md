This repository gathers information regarding several SW design, principles and patterns.

## GOOD DESIGN
***A good design could be achieved as a combination of applying several ideas/principles. It always depends on the context, not always the same approach can be used.*** 

In almost all good designs the following features can be identified in them:

>- **Simplicity:**
>- **ETC:**
>- **Understandable:**
>- **Consistency/Uniformity:**

In any case, a good design forces us to balance all the above features. As said previously, depending on the requirements and the context we should be flexible and take into account the trade-offs. When designing there is no rule to comply with.
