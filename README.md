# SW_NOTES
This repository gathers information regarding several SW design, principles and patterns.
Some ideas are compiled from distinguished authors as Donald Knuth, Niklaus Wirth, Kent Beck, Robert C Martin, David Thomas, Andrew Hunt...

## GOOD DESIGN
***A good design could be achieved as a combination of applying several ideas/principles. It always depends on the context, not always the same approach can be used.*** 

In almost all good designs the following features can be identified in them:

>- **Simplicity:** Possibly the hardest thing to achieve in any SW project. It requires a lot of practice and thinking (usually it is not the first idea). Simplicity is avoiding overengineering (less is more). In return it favors changes in the future. It may not sound fancy, but a simple design always pays off.
>- **Clarity:** SW is made by humans and read by them. therefore to favor collaboration is mandatory to be as clear as possible.
>    - **Consistency/Uniformity:** Using the same style helps to favor collaboration. Define processes and standards, thus everybody is aligned and any new member can contribute earlier.

In any case, a good design forces us to balance the features, not always is possible or desirable. As said previously, depending on the requirements and the context we should be flexible and take into account the trade-offs.

**When designing there are no  rules, only guidelines. Think twice before doing anything.**
